# Group_Project_3

For our Group 3 Project, we've focused on flight data between New York JFK and RDU,DEN,and AUS. Our interactive dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript supported by a SQL Library and a Flask API features four (4) visualizations displaying various facts about flight data. 


Our dropdown menu enables the user to select which destination to filter by. 

Our first graph displays the route planes take from the Departing Airport to the Arriving Airport. 

Our second graph displays more information about the aircraft manufacturer of planes flying between the two airports.

Our third graphs displays Departure Hours of flights connecting the two cities.

Finally, our fourth graph displays average taxi time from when the aircraft leaves the gate to when it departs.
